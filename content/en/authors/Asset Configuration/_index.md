Asset allocation is one of the key businesses of HSCRG. Our Asset Allocation business aims to help our clients optimize their asset portfolio and diversify risks to achieve long-term wealth enhancement.

### Risk assessment and target setting

During the asset allocation process, we first conduct a detailed risk assessment and target setting with our clients. We understand the client's risk tolerance, investment objectives, investment horizon and liquidity needs in order to formulate an asset allocation plan that suits the client's needs.

### Asset class selection

Based on the client's risk tolerance and goal setting, we select different asset classes to build the investment portfolio. Common asset classes include stocks, bonds, cash, real estate, commodities and so on. Based on market research and analysis, we select asset classes with potential and value for long-term returns and risk diversification.

### Asset Portfolio Construction

In the process of asset allocation, we combine different asset classes in certain ratios to form an investment portfolio based on our clients' risk tolerance and goal setting. We focus on diversification and diversification of assets to reduce the overall portfolio risk. The construction of asset portfolios can be weighed and optimized based on a number of factors such as cash flow, market value and yield.

### Periodic asset rebalancing

We regularly evaluate and adjust the portfolio to ensure that the asset allocation is effective and in line with the client's objectives. During the asset rebalancing process, we adjust the weightings of different asset classes to return to the target allocation based on market conditions and client needs. This helps to capture market opportunities, control risks and maintain long-term portfolio stability.

### Performance Monitoring and Reporting

We closely monitor the performance of our investment portfolios and provide regular performance reports to our clients. We use a variety of metrics and tools to assess portfolio returns and risks so that clients can understand how their asset allocation is performing. We communicate with our clients on a regular basis to provide expert advice on portfolio performance and adjustments.

### Flexibility in asset allocation strategies

Our asset allocation strategy has a degree of flexibility to adapt to changes in market conditions and changing client needs. We closely monitor changes in market trends and economic conditions and make timely adjustments to our asset allocation strategy to ensure that our clients' portfolios can adapt to the performance of different market conditions.
